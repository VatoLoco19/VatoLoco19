## Hi there,

<body>
Welcome to Christian Enlightenment Church LLC.,

My name is Michael,

My friend, I have read the Bible, and we are being mislead in so many ways. For example, the Church says that we must forgive to be forgiven, and that‚Äôs simply not true. What did Jesus say? Regarding Judgement Jesus said, ‚ÄúAfter he breathed on them he said, ‚ÄúReceive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive anyone‚Äôs sins, their sins are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven.‚Äù John 20: 22-24 Not everyone is forgiven.

With that being said, you can follow me on X https://x.com/ChristianEnligh to receive weekly teaching of the true Word of God. 


The Creed:


The Faith of Christianity

We believe in one God, the Holy Spirit, who is the Father of all creation, maker of all things both visible and invisible. We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, who is the only begotten of the Father. Spirit of Spirit. True God of True God. Jesus is from the substance of the Father, DNA of DNA, who for us men, and for our salvation, suffered and was crucified. Jesus, then rose from the dead on the third day. His disciples testify that they have seen and touched Him, and now Jesus sits at the Right Hand of God. One day Jesus will return to heal God‚Äôs people, to judge the wicked: with the power of God!



For prayer request, please write to ChristianEnlightenmentChurch@gmail.com or you can send me a message on X https://x.com/ChristianEnligh thank you.
