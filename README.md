## Hi there,

<body>
Welcome to Christian Enlightenment Church LLC.,

My name is Michael,

My friend, I have read the Bible, and we are being mislead in so many ways. For example, the Church says that we must forgive to be forgiven, and that‚Äôs simply not true. What did Jesus say? Regarding Judgement Jesus said, ‚ÄúAfter he breathed on them he said, ‚ÄúReceive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive anyone‚Äôs sins, their sins are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven.‚Äù John 20: 22-24 Not everyone is forgiven.

With that being said, this is the beginning of a New Beginning. Therefore, I invite you to spiritually walk with me, as I Spiritually walk with God. You can follow me on X https://x.com/ChristianEnligh to receive weekly teaching, and I challenge your knoledge. If you know better, please reach out to me to discuss the matter. Nonetheless, after researching the matter for many years, I declare a New Creed for the children of God.  


The Creed:


The Faith of Christ

We believe in one God, the Holy Spirit, who is the Father of all creation, maker of all things both visible and invisible. We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, who is the only begotten of the Father. Spirit of Spirit. True God of True God. Jesus is from the substance of the Father, DNA of DNA, who for us men, and for our salvation, suffered and was crucified. Jesus, then rose from the dead on the third day. His disciples testify that they have seen and touched Him, and now Jesus sits at the Right Hand of God. One day Jesus will return to heal God‚Äôs people and to judge the wicked: with the power of God!


If you know the Bible, then you would agree with this creed, because the Holy Spirit is the Father of Jesus Christ and not Christ Himself. We must remember what happened a long time ago, in a conversation, Philip said unto Jesus, "Lord, show us thy Father, and it sufficeth us." Jesus said unto Philip, "I have been with you for a very long time, and you don't known me, Philip?" "He that has seen me, has seen my Father." "How then can you say: "Show us thy Father?" You don't beleive, that I am in the Father, and the Father is in me? The very words that I speak unto you, are not mine, but the Father that dwelleth in me, he speaks the words, and it's He that doeth the works. Believe me, that I am in the Father, and the Father is in me: at the least, believe me for the very works‚Äô sake."

It's hear, by reading the Bible for ourselves, that we understand that it's the Holy Spirit that spoke through Jesus and healed the people. God entered Jesus after Jesus was baptized, as it is written: 

And Jesus when he was baptized, came straight out of the water. And lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and John saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon Jesus. And lo, a voice came from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Mattheww 3:16-17.  

So, when Jesus told the people, "Before Abraham was, I AM." God, the Holy Spirit was talking, not Jesus. 

My friend, I strongly invite you into the kingdom of God by accepting this understanding. If you know what I'm saying is the truth, then look around because the Spirit is near you. Pray to the Holy Spirit in Jesus name. Don't say, "Amen" at the end of your prayer. End your prayer with English words, like 'in Jesus name.' or 'so be it.' I explain why not to say 'Amen' in my book titled, "Amen" by Michael Porras on Amazon Kindle and Amazon.com. 

For prayer request, please write to ChristianEnlightenmentChurch@gmail.com or you can send me a message on X https://x.com/ChristianEnligh thank you for your time and may God have mercy on us.
